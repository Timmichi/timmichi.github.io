				<h1>About</h1>
				<img src="images/pfp.png" style="width: 10em; margin-top: -.5em;">
				<p></p>
				<p class="p1">
					My name is <span style="font-weight: bold">Timothy Simanhadi</span>, and I'm a Junior at UC Irvine
					studying Computer Science.
					If you don't know who I am outside of my LinkedIn profile or resume, then you probably already
					know my skillsets and qualifications. However, this page will show you my journey; something
					an 8.5 x 11 inch pdf can't tell you.
				</p>

				<p>
					There's plenty of smart people to go around. But people who can empathize with others or see their
					skills as a means for something greater than themselves? Unfortunately not much of that. For most
					of my life before college, I kept good grades but I really learned nothing. I
					went to church, but only because I was forced to. I was a cog in a machine called "life".
				</p>
				<p>
					But by the end of 2020 I'll have:
				<ul>
					<li>⁌ Competed in my first Hackathon ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Found my passion for programming ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Developed my first passion project ⁍</li>
					<li> ⁌ Raised $2000 to fly to Japan and spread the gospel ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Built lasting relationships ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Became a board member for a club I care about ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Started undergraduate research in IOT and AI ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Canvassed to hundreds of people for Doctors without Borders ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Landed my first job in the field of tech ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Learned how to live on my own ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Started making my own decisions ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Learned how to overcome rejections ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Found my purpose in life ⁍</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					These are the things I want to convey that I can't fit on my resume. For me, this is much more than
					a check list. It's a manifestation of what I'm proud of and who I've come to be. Being raised
					by loving parents who worked hard to create an environment for me to succeed, I always felt a need
					to chase success. And sometimes I still do. But now I know success has a different meaning. All
					these blessings only motivate me to use my skills to help people who don't have the advantages and
					opportunities I have.
