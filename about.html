				<h1>About</h1>
				<img src="images/pfp.png" style="width: 10em; margin-top: -.5em;">
				<p></p>
				<p>
					My name is Timothy Simanhadi, and I'm a Junior at UC Irvine studying Computer Science.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't know me already, then one thing you should know is if I can find a way to
					help others,
					I will. And I'll make sure to bring it full circle. No loose ends. No half promises.
					Often, you have people who are smart, but they can't work in a team, empathize
					with others,
					or see their skills as a means for a greater goal (and no I don't mean money).
					For most of my life before
					college - minus being smart - I
					was like this. Just
					going through the motions -
					not knowing what I stood for,
					not having a passion for anything, and basically being a cog in the machine of life.
				</p>
				<p>
					By the end of 2020 I will have:
				<ul>
					<li>⁌ Competed in my first Hackathon ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Found my passion for programming ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Developed my first passion project ⁍</li>
					<li> ⁌ Raised $2000 to fly to Japan and spread the gospel ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Solidified amazing friend groups ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Became a board member for a club I care about ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Started undergraduate research in IOT and AI ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Canvassed to hundreds of people for Doctors without Borders ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Landed my first job outside of the food industry ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Learned how to live on my own ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Started making my own decisions ⁍</li>
					<li>⁌ Faced rejection hundereds of times ⁍</li>
					<li> ⁌ Started to understand my purpose ⁍</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					For me, these are big strides in personal growth. Being born and raised in Sacramento by loving
					parents who came
					from little and
					succeeded in achieving
					the American Dream, I always felt a need to prove something to them because I had such a
					privileged life.
					And sometimes I
					still do. But
					this is who I am, and these
					are the things I've done. Yes, I've had a ton of help. Yes, I have people who care about me. Yes, I
					am
					privileged. That's why I want to
					use what I've learned to help people who don't have the advantages and
					opportunities I have.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks for coming to my ted talk. If you made it this far you a real one.
